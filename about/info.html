  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
  
  <p>
    I hold a PhD in Chemical Engineering from <a href="http://lsu.edu" target="_blank">Louisiana State University</a>, where I defended my dissertation "Multi-Scale Modeling of Electrochemical Separation: From Material Modeling to Process Optimization" in January 2025 under <a href="https://www.lsu.edu/eng/che/people/faculty/roma.php" target="_blank">Professor Jose Romagnoli</a> and <a href="https://faculty.lsu.edu/revatik/index.php" target="_blank">Professor Revati Kumar</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My PhD research centered on multi-scale modeling of electrochemical systems using numerical modeling, machine learning, and molecular dynamics. During my PhD, I interned at Dow Chemical in 2023, developing machine learning solutions for surfactant formulation.

    In February 2025, I joined <a href="https://www.corteva.com/" target="_blank">Corteva Agriscience</a> as a Junior Data Scientist (contract), applying numerical and data-driven modeling to agricultural innovation. See <a href="#experiences">experiences</a> for previous industrial attachments.
